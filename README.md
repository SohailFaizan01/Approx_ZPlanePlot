# Approx_ZPlanePlot
An approximate Z Plane plotting code 
This code takes real signal data and does point-wise z transform and plots a 3D plot.
The number of points and number of axii along which the points are calculated are all configurable.
The coloring scale is also configurable. The color changes from blue to red depending on the magnitude, with the highest magnitude colored red and lowest as blues.
